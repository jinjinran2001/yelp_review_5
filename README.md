# yelp_review_5
Here we fine-tune a pretrained GPT2 model for text classification on the Yelp review dataset. The dataset consists of 5 classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We fine-tune the model to predict the rating of the review based on the text content. The model is trained on the Yelp review dataset and then evaluated on a test set to measure its performance. The best performing model achieves an accuracy of 0.68 on the test set, which is a significant improvement over the baseline accuracy of 0.20. The model is able to predict the rating of the review with a reasonable degree of accuracy, which demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning a pretrained GPT2 model for text classification tasks.
